The recent global crisis has led experts to address several problems and 
propose solutions. Despite all this, one specialization area that has 
boomed is Data Science. The role of a data scientist has become one of the 
most sought-after roles in the US.

As students waiting to enter the industry and honing our skills to grab the most 
lucrative job in the market, we are interested in the data from the most popular website 
for information about jobs. Thus for this study, we use a Kaggle dataset compiled from 
“www.glassdoor.com“ in the United States to dive deeper into Salary estimates for data scientists based on 
location, company, industry, and skillset. Furthermore, we are also able to provide the lower and upper salary estimates, as well as averages, 
leading potential applicants to better understand and manage their expectations.

We have used five external libraries in the code, FullPage for making the 
complete page scrollable, and D3 cloud layout library for Word Cloud. 
We have also used Bootstrap for easier formatting, jQuery which was required for 
FullPage and D3 library.

The third visualization, highlights the most in-demand skills, is an Overview + Detail type
of visualization where we provide an overview using the mini-bar chart on the right
side, while user can choose to focus and view details of specific region by brush.

The fourth visualization tries to help future data scientists by pushing them to learn
in-demand skills for the job roles they want, and also guides them to apply for those
roles in specific states.

The sixth visualization, parallel chart has an animation where we continue highlighting
some lines based on company size, and user can click on any labels or axis title to 
stop the animation. User can also choose to select a categorical data by clicking 
on the axis label, while linear data like Age & Salary can be highlighted using axis 
brush. Clicking on the axis label will reset the selection for that particular axis.
